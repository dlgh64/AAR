AAR Brain stroming:

1. An electronic tour guide with audio augmented reality in the form of a frame

2. Acoustically transparent audio simultaneous interpretation (perhaps eliminating the corresponding human voice while delivering the translated virtual audio through an augmented reality headset?)

3. Education?

4. Providing people with guidance and information during emergencies through audio AR? (maybe not realistic)

5. Directional navigation audio provided by the car's driver's seat headrest？ (heard only by the driver)



做一个侦测真实世界的声音 然后将他转变为一个虚拟的声音  比如： 狗叫——————猫叫
